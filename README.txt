Music genre prediction - prediciting musical genres based off acoustic features. 

This project I endeavored to predict musical genres from a wide array of pre-extracted acoustic features using various ML classification models. The acoustic features
were extracted from a 30 second clip of over 100,000 songs on Free Music Archieve. The feature extractions were completed by MichaÃ«l Defferrard in a paper titled 
'FMA: A Dataset For Music Analysis' (2017) (arXiv link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01840.pdf, GitHub link:https://github.com/mdeff/fma) This project was inspired by creating more genre specific playlists on 
streaming services, while certainly was not able to accomplish that I learned a substantial amount about feature extraction from audio samples, multi-class classifcation,
and the process of creating and testing models.
